[![Open in Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20with-Streamlit-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=streamlit)](https://sleeeepy.streamlit.app/) 

### üîç **Overview**

The Streamlit app is a comprehensive tool designed to provide insights into sleep health and lifestyle. It features a user-friendly interface with a navigation bar allowing access to sleep disorder prediction and exploratory data analysis (EDA). On the Predict page, users input health metrics like sleep duration, physical activity, stress level, weight, height, heart rate, steps, and blood pressure to get a prediction of potential sleep disorders using a Decision Tree Classifier. The app automatically calculates BMI and categorizes it, offering immediate feedback. 

On the EDA page, users can explore the dataset through various interactive visualizations, including gender distribution, BMI categories, occupation distribution, heart rate and stress levels by age group, and sleep disorders by gender and occupation. Built with Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, and Scikit-learn, the app seamlessly integrates data processing, model training, and visualization to enhance user understanding of sleep health.
